## Description

This is a sample implmentation of [Conway's famous Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The implementation uses [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
Actually the main motivation for this project is experimenting with this new feature of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Work in progress...

## Usage

1. Set Birth / Survival min-max parameters.
   Optional: settings of the original Conway game are set by default.

2. Set starting population by clicking on the cells to make them alive.

3. Click on the PLAY - STOP button to start - stop continuous process,
   or click on the STEP (footprint) button repeatedly to proceed step-by-step.

4. Click on the CLEAR button (X) to clear the board.
