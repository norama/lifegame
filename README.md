## Description

This is a sample implmentation of [Conway's famous Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The implementation uses [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
Actuallz, the main motivation for this project is experimenting with this new feature of [React](https://reactjs.org/).
